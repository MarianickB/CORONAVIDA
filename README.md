# CORONAVIDA
We present to you the code we have made. We did not make it in time to host a website on GitHub :( Really sorry for the inconvenience!

However, if you download the files to open in a text editor, or if you copy paste them directly onto files you create (with the same name as how we've named them) in a text editor, you should be able to test out our project! 

For the website: 
1. Open text editor (we used Atom because there's a live server plug-in called atom-live-server!)

2. Import files and store in same folder OR create 4 different files with the same names of our files (our two htmls and two js) and copy the code in them respectively. 

3. Make sure both .js files are in a "scripts" folder, inside the main folder.

4. Use a live server to open project. 

5. You will have a menu of the files.

6. Click on publicMap and make an account (sign-up). You should see a map with markers (refresh the page if you don't... there is still one bug we can't seem to figure out). These markers are there for display and are not real data, but the blue markers represent hospitals, orange are suspected areas of infection, and red are areas that have been confirmed to be contaminated by the virus. 

7. Go back and click on myMap. You should see your own map and you can add markers and submit (this is what a user would do when logging where they have been in the last 14 days). It should be saved for next time you come on or if you refresh.

8. You can also sign out, and log back in. It's all functional (or at least up until last time we checked!). 


For the XD file:
1. Open on XD to view our visualization of what the App would look like.
