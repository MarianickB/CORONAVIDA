# CORONAVIDA
We present to you the code we have made. We did not make it in time to host a website on GitHub :( However, if you download the files and open them in a text editor, you should be able to test out our project! 

For the website: 
1. Open text editor (we used Atom because there's a live server plug-in called atom-live-server!)
2. Import files
3. Make sure both .js files are in a "scripts" folder
4. Use a live server to open project. 
5. You will have a menu of the files.
6. Click on PublicMap and make an account. You should see a map with markers
7. Go back and click on MyMap. You should see your own map and you can add markers and submit. It should be saved for next time you come on. 
8. You can also sign out, and log back in. It's all functional. 


For the XD file:
1. Open on XD
